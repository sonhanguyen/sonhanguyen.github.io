title: Building static websites with Next.js
---

Now that my new personal website is up, I thought I should dedicate the first post to reflect on the tools I've chosen to build it with.

# "That's my Jam"
One thing I wanted to avoid having to deal with in my personal website is a CMS. Yes you heard me right, the one thing that once's very essential to web projects are no longer. If you are familiar with static generators such as Hugo or the concept the JAM stack, no explanation is needed. If you are not, you can look them up but to me the key thing is that I prefer the whole website to be self-contained in a git repo with all the content version-controlled being an added benefit.

# Gatsby

With that in mind, I looked up a few options. I was only looking within the React ecosystem since that's what I've been doing the most recently and the idea of a statically generated website just means that there is very little reason to deal with a second language other than javascript in the front-end, if not just plain old html. I started with React-Static which is one of the most bare-bone options but along the way the company where I work started to investigate Gatsby and Nextjs for our marketing website. So I tried Gatsby first. I found Ga big development community behind Gatsby with an extensive plugin ecosystem. There are just a lot more examples to integrate with most content services/CIs so setting up a deployment pipeline is a very quick process. Gatsby pairs naturally with md and mdx which are perfect fits for my need (git-versioned content). So what's not to like?

## Graphql
Gatsby is easily the most popular choice to build static site these days and at the heart of its selling point is [graphql](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/why-gatsby-uses-graphql). Before passing any criticism let me just say graphql is a great tool to build web api
